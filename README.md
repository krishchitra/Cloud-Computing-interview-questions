________________________________________
7) What are the different layers in cloud computing? Explain working of them.
There are 3 layers in the hierarchy of cloud computing.
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):It provides cloud infrastructure in terms of hardware as like memory, processor, speed etc.
Platform as a service (PaaS):It provides cloud application platform for the developer.
Software as a service (SaaS)::It provides the cloud applications to users directly without installing anything on the system. These applications remains on cloud.
________________________________________
8) What do you mean by software as a service?
Software As a Service (SaaS) is an important layer of cloud computing. It provides cloud applications like Google is doing. It facilitate users to save their document on the cloud and create as well.
________________________________________
9) What is the platform as a service?
It is also a layer in cloud architecture. This model is built on the infrastructure model and provide resources like computers, storage and network. It is responsible to provide complete virtualization of the infrastructure layer, make it look like a single server and invisible for outside world.
________________________________________
10) What is on-demand functionality? How is it provided in cloud computing?
Cloud computing provides a on-demand access to the virtualized IT resources. It can be used by the subscriber. It uses shared pool to provide configurable resources. Shared pool contains networks, servers, storage, applications and services.
________________________________________
11) What are the platforms used for large scale cloud computing?
Apache Hadoop and MapReduce are the platforms use for large scale cloud computing.
________________________________________
12) What are the different models for deployment in cloud computing?
These are the different deployment model in cloud computing:
Private cloud
Public cloud
Hybrid cloud
Community cloud
________________________________________
13) What is private cloud?
Private clouds are used to keep the strategic operations and other reasons secure. It is a complete platform which is fully functional and can be owned, operated and restricted to only an organization or an industry. Now a day, most of the organizations have moved to private clouds due to security concerns. Virtual private cloud is being used that operate by a hosting company.
________________________________________
14) What is public cloud?
The public clouds are open to the people for use and deployment. For example: Google and Amazon etc. The public clouds focus on a few layers like cloud application, infrastructure providing and providing platform markets.
________________________________________
15) What are Hybrid clouds?
Hybrid clouds are the combination of public clouds and private clouds. It is preferred over both the clouds because it applies most robust approach to implement cloud architecture. It includes the functionalities and features of both the worlds. It allows organizations to create their own cloud and allow them to give the control over to someone else as well.
________________________________________
16) What is the difference between cloud computing and mobile computing?
Mobile computing and cloud computing are slightly same in concept. Mobile computing uses the concept of cloud computing . Cloud computing provides users the data which they required while in mobile computing, applications run on the remote server and gives user the access for storage and manage.
________________________________________
17) What is the difference between scalability and elasticity?
Scalability is a characteristic of cloud computing which is used to handle the increasing workload by increasing in proportion amount of resource capacity. By the use of scalability, the architecture provides on demand resources if the requirement is being raised by the traffic. Whereas, Elasticity is a characteristic which provides the concept of commissioning and decommissioning of large amount of resource capacity dynamically. It is measured by the speed by which the resources are coming on demand and the usage of the resources.
________________________________________
18) What are the security benefits of cloud computing?
Cloud computing authorizes the application service, so it is used in identity management.
It provides permissions to the users so that they can control the access of another user who is entering into the cloud environment.
________________________________________
19) What is the usage of utility computing?
Utility computing is a plug-in managed by an organization which decides what type of services has to be deployed from the cloud. It facilitates users to pay only for what they use.
________________________________________
20) What is "EUCALYPTUS" in cloud computing? Why is it used?
It is an acronym stands for Elastic Utility Computing Architecture For Linking Your Program To Useful Systems. It is an open source software infrastructure in cloud computing and used to implement clusters in cloud computing platform. It creates public, private and hybrid cloud. It facilitate a user to create his own data center into a private cloud and use its functionalities to many other organizations.
________________________________________
21) Explain System integrators in cloud computing.
System integrator provides a strategy of a complicated process used to design a cloud platform. It creates more accurate hybrid and private cloud network because integrator have all the knowledge about the data center creation.
________________________________________
22) What are the open source cloud computing platform databases?
MongoDB, CouchDB, LucidDB are the example of open source cloud computing platform database.
________________________________________
23) Give some example of large cloud provider and databases?
Google bigtable
Amazon simpleDB
Cloud based SQL
________________________________________
24) What is the difference between cloud and traditional datacenters?
The cost of the traditional datacenter is higher than cloud because in traditional databases, there is overheating problems and some software and hardware issue.
________________________________________
25) What are the different in Software as a Service (SaaS)?
Simple Multi-tenancy:In this mode, Every user has independent resources and are uniquely different from other users. This is an efficient mode.
Fine grain multi-tenancy:: In this mode, the resources can be shared by many users but the functionality remains the same.
________________________________________
26) Why API's is used in cloud services?
API's (Application Programming Interfaces) is used in cloud platform because:
It provide an alternative way that you don't need to write the fully fledged program.
It makes communication between one or more applications.
It creates applications and link the cloud services with other systems.
________________________________________

37) How would you secure data for transport in cloud?
This is the most obvious question accurued in mind that if the cloud data is secure; To ensure that, check that there is no data leak with the encryption key implemented with the data you sending while the data moves from point A to point B in cloud.
